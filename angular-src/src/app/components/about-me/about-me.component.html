				My name is David Maman, I am a developer and this is my second project.
				<br>
				My first project was an application for sending messages to Android phones.
				A very challenging project where I learned a lot about how to work on server and client side.
				The server side was written in PHP and the client side in JAVA.

			<h4><ins>Employee Managament</ins></h4>
			<p>
				For a few years I have been working as a security guard, currently working at the <i><b>President's Residence</b></i>.
				<br>
				Working as a security guard means working shifts.
				Up until a few years ago employee shift management was done manually, employees would send the manager what shifts they can / can not work during a week and the manager tried to take the requests into consideration.
				If their are a small amount of guards then this would be an easy proccess to do manually, but if their are a lot of employees, manual shift managment can become very problematic.
				I've created my project to try to provide a management solution.
				<br>
				On this project I am working with NodeJS, Express, Mongodb, MLab, Angular and Heroku.
			</p>
			<h3><ins>How It Works</ins></h3>
			<p>
				Registration is solely for the employee.<br>
				To register you need to contact the manager.<br>
				After log-in there are several options and administrator notifications.<br>
				Options in Home Page:<br>
				<li><i><b>Profile page</b></i></li>
				<li>The <i><b>Edit Personal Details</b></i> page does not require updating your password.</li>
				<li><i><b>Contact</b></i> page: List of contacts in the system records. Mailing option is currently inactive.</li>
				<li><i><b>Week</b></i> page: Here the employee is shown the number of shifts he or she is required to <i>open</i>.</li>
				<br>
				To receive admin privileges please contact me by e-mail.
